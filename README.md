# myWebsite

The goal for this project is to create a personalized website as a portal for anything anybody might need or want from me. The home page will have a sleek navigation bar with a seamless transition to each of its elements.<br>
The nav bar will contain: "myName, Services, Blog, Resume, GitHub" <br>
The website will use a MERN stack (MongoDB,Express,React,Node.js)
